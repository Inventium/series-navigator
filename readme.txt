Link Navigator helps you build navigation links 
in your WordPress blog.

The idea is using custom fields to define the 
next and previous articles.

The plugin examines the custom field, 
extracts the link and optional anchor
text and description, then displays
according to a prewritten style sheet.
Thus, all of your navigation within 
articles can be styled uniformly.

And there's more: the plugin is written 
to exploit the WordPress shortcode 
interface.  This makes it possible 
to add your navigation links anywhere
you like in your blog post, with a 
very simple shortcode: [navigation-links].

The custom field keys are 'next' and 'previous'.

The custom field values are a list of 0-3
values.  If you don't put any values, 
nothing is displayed.  Here's the order:
url::anchor text::description

The double colon "::" separates the 
values so the plugin knows which is 
which. (It's surprisingly difficult 
to make this any easier for users.)
